            <h2>Alsace</h2>
            <p>
                Alsace is on the border with Germany and makes aromatic wines with their very own character and style.
                The grape variety is always clearly indicated on the label, which is rare in France, where otherwise origin is considered more important. 
                The local food is somewhat rustic (choucroute/sauerkraut, stews etc) but goes surprisingly well with the elegant Riesling wines with varying degrees of sweetness. 
                Other grape varieties of note are the rose-scented Gewurztraminer and the full-bodied Pinot Gris.
                The whites dominate, but you can find light and refreshing Pinot Noir wines.

        <div class="general-fact">
            <h2>Burgundy</h2>
            Burgundy begins with Chablis in the north, 125 miles south of Paris. Here, the relatively cool climate gives white wines from Chardonnay that are crispy and fresh.
            Further south, in the Côte d’Or, the whites, also from Chardonnay, are more full-bodied and oaky.
            The reds from Pinot Noir are very prestigious with prices to match.
            The best ones are exquisite and velvety. Burgundy ends with Beaujolais.
            Here, the Gamay grape gives fruity, fresh and often juicy and easy-drinking wines.

    <section class="fact-section">

        <div class="general-fact">
            <h2>Champagne</h2>
            <p>
                The world’s most famous sparkling wines are made from grapes that grow in a rather tricky climate in northern France. 
                The upside is the high acidity which is paramount for high-quality sparkling wine. The grapes that are allowed are Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier.
                The bubbles are formed during the second fermentation in the bottle.
                This way to make sparkling wine is called the méthode champenoise in Champagne and méthode traditionelle, the traditional method, elsewhere.
