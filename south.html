            <h2>Bordeaux</h2>
            <p>
                Bordeaux is one of France’s largest wine regions and the most famous, known for its beautiful chateaux and prestigious (as well as expensive) red wines.
                But many of the lesser wine estates make excellent wines at very reasonable prices.
                But they suffer from their exclusive cousins’ reputation for being expensive.
                Bordeaux also makes some of the world’s finest sweet wines. Sauternes is made with noble rot grapes, naturally luscious sweet.
                The dry white Bordeaux wines can be magnificent and deserve more attention.
                The main red grapes in Bordeaux are Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot; the whites are Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc.

                Located on the Mediterranean coast, Provence lies east of the Rhône River.
                The landscape is spectacular, with vineyards, lavender fields, olive groves and mountains.

                But there are also full-bodied whites from the fishing village of Cassis and reds from Bandol, Coteaux d’Aix en Provence and Les Baux.
                The grapes are Grenache, Mourvèdre, Cinsault and Counoise.

            <h2>Rhône</h2>
            <p>
                On the slopes of the Rhône River just south of Lyon, we find some of France’s most sought-after red wines: Côte Rôtie, Saint Joseph, Hermitage and Crozes-Hermitage.
                They are all made from Syrah. A small amount of high-quality white is made in Condrieu, from the floral and full-bodied Viognier.
                The southern Rhône Valley has always been associated with the prestigious wines of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, but there are now many other exciting appellations with ambitious producers, such as Gigondas, Vacqueyras, Rasteau, Costières de Nîmes to mention a few.
                Grenache and Syrah are the main grapes, and the wines are filled with herbal notes, spices and a warm, southern feeling.
