            <h2>General fact</h2>
            <p>
                France has always been considered the homeland of quality wines, and the originals of almost all classic wines is assumed to come from France. <br>
                But they are also a big producer of quantity wines. Next after Italy, they are the most wine producing country in the world. With around 46,7 milion hector liter each year. <br>
                So how can we know what wine that is quality wine or quantity wine? A smart way is to undertand the label on the bottle and the wine classification in France. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>    
                In France there is three classification for wines. We have the highest class: Appellation di Origine Contrôlée or AOC. It is wine from small areas with special rules for which grapes and methods that may be used. <br>
                And then we have Vin de Pays or VdP, it is wine from a geographical area but there are not the same hard rule on method and grapes. And the last one is called Vin de France it can come from any were in France.
                Maybe it is easy for a Frenchman to know what grape and method that is used to make the wine just by seeing the label of the wine. But for a forign it can be harder. <br>
                I have chosen to divide France into north and south regions.<br>
                In the north regions we have: Alsace, Bourgogne, Champagne and Loire. <br> 
                And in South we have: Bordeaux, Provence and Rhône.
